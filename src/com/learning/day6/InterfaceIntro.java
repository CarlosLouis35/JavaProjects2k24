// this is another way to achieve abstraction	
//	An interface is a completely abstract class
// to access the interface methods, the interface must 
//	be implemented by another class with keyword called implements 	

//	interface can not be used to create objects
//	interface we can only have abstract classes
//	When any class implementing an interface that class
//	must provide the implementation for all of its methods
//	Interface -> methods -> default -> abstract and public
//	          -> Attributes -> by default -> public, static and final.
//	An interface can not contain a constructor
	
// -> security
//	-> by using interfaces we can implement Multiple inheritances.
